# Fixed ICD-11 API Error - TyperError for Array Parameter

## Problem
There was a fatal error when accessing the ICD-11 API endpoint:
```
Fatal error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot access offset of type array in isset or empty in C:\laragon\www\clinica\api\services\Icd11Service.php:101
```

## Root Cause
The Router was not properly extracting URL parameters from routes like `disease/{code}` and was passing an entire array of parameters to the controller method instead of extracting the individual parameter values. This caused the `$code` parameter in the ICD11Service to be an array instead of a string.

## Fixes Applied

1. **Router Class (`api/core/Router.php`)**:
   - Improved the route pattern matching to correctly extract named parameters from URLs
   - Added a special case to extract the 'code' parameter and pass it directly to the controller
   - Fixed the regex pattern to use named capture groups

2. **ICD11 Controller (`api/controllers/ICD11Controller.php`)**:
   - Added type checking and handling for when `$code` is received as an array
   - Added error logging to help diagnose future issues
   - Improved response code handling to ensure it's always a string

3. **ICD11 Service (`api/services/Icd11Service.php`)**:
   - Added type checking in the `getFallbackData` method to handle cases when `$code` is an array
   - Added similar type checking in `getDetailedDiseaseByCode`
   - Improved the documentation to reflect that parameters might be arrays

## Verification
Created and ran a test script (`test_icd11_router.php`) that verifies all the routes are now working correctly with various ICD-11 codes.

## How to Test
1. Access the endpoint directly: `/clinica/api/disease/MD12`
2. Use the test page: `/clinica/icd11_test.html`
3. Run the test script: `php -f test_icd11_router.php`
